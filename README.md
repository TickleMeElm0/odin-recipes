# odin-recipes
This current project is to create a website using only HTML. 
I will go through 4 iterations with each iteration having different criteria. 
This will allow me to practice using my HTML skills as well as my github skills.
Iteration 1: initial structure
Iteration 2: recipe page
Iteration 3: recipe page content
Iteration 4: add more recipes
